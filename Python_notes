Python 

print statement: print('helloworld')


python code executes line by line
print('*' * 10) we get 10 stars here
we can declare variables in python and use them when ever wanted
name = "nithees"
print(name)
receiving input in python:
we use input function in python to take input
name = input(what your name?)
print(name)

type conversion:
In python the input is taken as a string and this will be a problem because even when we 
pass integer it is taken as string so use int() function which is used to convert string into integer
int(variable)

String:
In python we use Apostrophe and quotation marks for strings if we want any of the word to be used
with Apostrophe then the string should be placed in quotation marks and vice versa
Example: name = "python's course"
name = 'python for "beginners" '
In python we use '''''' triple apostrophe or triple quotation to write multiple lines
 name = '''hi
 what your name
 my anke is asd
 '''
We can get character at a particular index in python using square brackets and we can also get the indexes from
the last using negative indexes
name="nitheesh"
print(name[0]) //n
print(name[-1]) //h
print(name[0:3]) //nit
print(name[0:]) //nitheesh
print(name[1:-1]) //ithees

formatted strings
We use curly braces with in we write the name of the variable we want to display
with a f before the string declearation, this is used for dynamically inserting the strings
first = nitheesh
name = f'{first} is the name of user'

string methods:
name = 'nitheesh'
print(len(name)) //8
name.upper()
name.lower()
name.find(t) //returns the index of t
name.replace('ee', 'e') // will replace ee in name to e
print("ee" in name) //it returns true or false on basis of the string is available or not

Arithmetic Operations:
print(10 + 3)
print(10 - 3)
print(10 * 3)
print(10 / 3) //3.33
print(10 // 3) //3
print(10 % 3) //1
print(10 ** 3) //1000 this is exponent operator
agumented operator
x += 3 //this is equal to x = x+3

operator precedence: BODMOS(bracket, order, division, multiplication, addition, substraction)
the order in which the operators are executed

math functions:
x=2.9
round(x) //3
abs(-2.9)  //2.9 abs function gives us positive value even if we pass negative value
we can also use math library by importing it
math.ceil(2.9) //3 this gives the upper limit of the varivbale
math.floor(2.9) //2 this gives the lower limit of the variable


if statements:
price = 1000000
good_credit = True
if good_credit:
    down_payment = 0.1 * 1000000
else:
    down_payment = 0.2 * 1000000
print(f"Down Payment: {down_payment}")


Logical operators:
and, or are logical operators
we use and when two conditions must be true and or when only one is true
if ............. and/or/and not ........... :
	print()
we use not operator when we dont want that condition to be true	


comparison operators:
<, <=, >, >=, ==, != are some of the operators





================================================================
python functions:
print()-> for printing the data
input()-> to recievie input
type()-> this is used to find the tyoe of the variable
int(variable)-> this is used to convert string into integer
len()-> to find the length of a string
math functions-> used with math prefix and by importing math module
