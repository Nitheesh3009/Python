Python 

print statement: print('helloworld')


python code executes line by line
print('*' * 10) we get 10 stars here
we can declare variables in python and use them when ever wanted
name = "nithees"
print(name)
receiving input in python:
we use input function in python to take input
name = input(what your name?)
print(name)

type conversion:
In python the input is taken as a string and this will be a problem because even when we 
pass integer it is taken as string so use int() function which is used to convert string into integer
int(variable)











================================================================
python functions:
print()-> for printing the data
input()-> to recievie input
type()-> this is used to find the tyoe of the variable
int(variable)-> this is used to convert string into integer
